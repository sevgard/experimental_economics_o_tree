        <b> The decision situation </b>
    </center>
    <p>
        You will be a member of a group of {{Constants.group_size}} people. Each member has to decide on the division
        of {{ Constants.endowment }} (your endowment). You can put these {{ Constants.endowment }} on a private account
        or you can invest them fully or partially in a project. Each point you do not invest in the project will be
        automatically transferred to your private account. The experiment is conducted only once.
    </p>
    <center>
        <b> Income from the private account </b>
    </center>
    <p>
        For each point that you put on your private account, you will earn exactly one point. For example, if you
        put 200 points on your private account (which implies that you do not invest anything in the project) you
        will earn exactly 200 points. If you put 60 points into the private account, you
        will receive an income of 60 points from the private account.
        Nobody except you earns something from your private account.
    </p>
    <center>
        <b> Your income from the project </b>
    </center>
    <p>
        From the number of points invested in the project each group member will get the same payoff, the so-called
        individual share. For each group member the income from the project, so the individual share, will be determined as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <center>
            <i>Income from the project = individual share = sum of investments in the project * {{ Constants.multiplier }}</i>
        </center>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if the sum of all investments in the project is {{ Constants.endowment }}, then you and all your group members
        get a payoff of {{ Constants.endowment }} x {{ Constants.multiplier }} = 100 points from the project.
    </p>
    <center>
        <b> Total income </b>
    </center>
    <p>
        Your total earnings are the sum of income from your private account and the project:
    </p>
    <p>
        <center>
            <i> Earnings = ({{ Constants.endowment }} - investments in the project) + {{ Constants.multiplier }} * sum of all investments in the project </i>
        </center>
    </p>
    <center>
        <b> Clock mechanism with no feedback </b>
    </center>

    <p>
        In contrast to the first stage, the investment in the project is counted upwards like a clock.
        The initial investment in the project is 0 points for every player in the group. Every 30 seconds
        the investment increases by {{Constants.increment}} points. Every round you have to
        make a decision whether to invest these additional {{Constants.increment}} points and stay
        in the game or to exit the game. If you press <b>NO</b> button and exit the game, your final investment
        in the project will be equal to the level of investment displayed on the page. If you press <b>YES</b>
        button or do not press any button within 30 seconds, you automatically invest additional {{Constants.increment}}
        points and proceed to the next round.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the game players cannot observe whether one of their group members exited the game. A player who exited
        the game cannot return to the game afterwards and should wait till other players finish the game.
    </p>
    <center>
        <b> After the game ends </b>
    </center>
    <p>
        After the last round the results of the game with your payoff (in points) will be displayed on a separate
        page. After the game you will receive your payoff in a separate, sealed envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the experiment we will not speak of Euros but of (experimental) points.
        Your entire earnings will be calculated in points. At the
        end of the experiment the total number of points you have earned will be converted
        to Euros at the following rate: <b>1 point = 0.05â‚¬ = 5 Eurocents</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be provided with on-screen calculator, pen and paper.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Now please answer several questions to check whether you fully understand the rules.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        After answering the questions you will be randomly assigned to the groups and proceed to the main
        part of the experiment.
